## 2.2.1 - 2025-02-01

* Performance improvements:
  * Optimized `_getCustomMapping` method to avoid throwing exceptions for enums without custom values
  * Added caching for string representations of enum values in `fromString` method to avoid repeated conversions
  * Fixed performance regression reported in issues #35 and #36
  * Added benchmark tests to measure performance improvements

## 2.2.0

* Added support for enhanced enums (Dart 2.17+)
* Added ability to use custom string mappings with enhanced enums
* Minimum SDK version increased to 2.17.0

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-17

- Added new `capitalizeWords` flag to control word capitalization in camelCase conversion
- When used with `camelCase: true`, setting `capitalizeWords: true` will capitalize all words instead of just the first one
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing behavior

## [2.0.1]

- No reason not to be bumped to prod with null safety

## [2.0.0-nullsafety.1]

- Big version bump to try and get pub's outdated check to recognise a null safe version is available.

## [1.0.14-nullsafety.0]

- First attempt at moving to nullsafety. Cheers to @Sameerkash for spearheading the effort.

## [1.0.14] - 2020-11-20

- Added camelCase flag in "fromString" function to properly handle conversion back of a string with spaces to enum

## [1.0.13] - 2020-09-25

- Fixed previous bug by replacing exception with an assertion. The library will no longer break in release mode with minified code, but it will also not throw an exception in production if you try to parse a non enum item.

## [1.0.12] - 2020-09-24

- Fixing issue where minification in the web breaks the app. Unfortunately we can't safely check if the object type is an enum when compiled in release mode using type.toString as a result of this change.
